Follow the steps, all you need to do:

    Step 1: Open up a terminal
    Step 2: sudo nano /etc/default/grub
    Step 3: At the very end of the string GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT, (which in my case was “quiet splash,”) add acpi_backlight=native.
    The final string, in my case, looks like “quiet splash acpi_backlight=native“
    Step 4: Close and save the file, and run sudo update-grub and then reboot.
    
    Completed !!
